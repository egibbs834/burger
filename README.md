# Eat-Da-Burger

This application is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it will display the burger on the top of the page, waiting to be devoured. The user can then click the DEVOUR button next to their burger, which will add the burger to the Burgers Devoured section.
